            <img src="assets/images/selfie.png" alt="picture of Marc">
            <p>    
                    In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                    And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'            </p>
            <p>    
                    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                    The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
                    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
                    But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
            </p>
            <p>    
                    I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
                    And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
                    I looked at my kingdom
                    I was finally there
                    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air            </p>
