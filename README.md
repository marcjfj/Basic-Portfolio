#Basic-Portfolio

- Made the layout reasonably close to the prompt

- Used a flexbox technique to achieve the sticky footer

- Did some hover effects on the nav

- For the portfolio page, I just set the images to pull dynamically from the lorempixel API. I figured that between the "About" picture and the background pattern, I'd shown competence in putting image files in a folder.
